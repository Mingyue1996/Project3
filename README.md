1. When player vs computer, player starts first
2. Player’s user name cannot be Computer. 
3. The user name entered by the player cannot be found in the list; otherwise, you will see error prompts.
4. Once users choose to use a previous username, they have to use the previous marker as well even if they enter a new marker.
5. Click on “quit” to save game results permanently. If you click on the “close” button on the top right of the UI, then game results will not be permanently saved.
6. Most Important: Check the image I put called directory in the file to put all the files in correct positions. You might need to create a JavaFX project first in eclipse. This “directory” image has nothing to do with my project. The worst case is to go to my github to make everything work: https://github.com/Mingyue1996/Project3
7. I only have sounds for win/loss. No animation. No sound for a tie. The professor said it is OK.
8. Important: You have to click on the button “Choose user name” each time you choose a user name. If you see a list, but you don’t click on the button “Choose user name”, the project might not work.
9. You might not see “it is Computer’s” turn because this label changes very fast and you cannot see it. This is not an error.
10. cn.png, gb.png, us.png are all considered as images.
